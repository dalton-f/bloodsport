Bloodsport is our retro, styled wave-based shooter built in the classic PSX style. Face swarms of enemies, surviving wave after wave, pushing your skills to the limit in a small arena. Dying isn't the end. It's your powerup.

Made across 4 days for the Jamsepticeye game jam co-run by Jacksepticeye and John "Ducky Dev" Szymanski!
